    Following the logic in
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61550137/using-graphviz-yed-to-produce-a-timeline-graph
    this method aims to create an aligned timeline graph as a form of a gantt chart.

    Each model will be represented as a cluster, and by using ranks
    and invisible nodes we can create a bar representing the duration
    of the model by time:

            ----- cluster_nodeA -----
      ---> | node_start         node | --->
            -------------------------
                T                T+1

    In this case, node_start will be aligned with the interval
    assigned for the start of the task, and node will be aligned
    with the interval of the end of the task. We can align
    nodes in graphviz by using ranks.

    If, either because of the duration of the task or the size
    of the intervals, the node_start and node fall in the same rank,
    we will skip the creation og the node_start node:

            - cluster_nodeA -
      ---> |      node       | --->
            -----------------
                   T
    This will prevent a cluster with two nodes stacked on top of each
    other, making the cluster wider.

    By making the nodes inside the cluster invisible, we will reduce
    the overlapping of nodes and lines.

    Edges will be referenced using the internal nodes in the cluster,
    so we can create downstream edges at the end (node) of the gantt
    bar per node, and upstream edges at the start of the cluster (node_start).
